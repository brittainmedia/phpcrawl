Initially just a copy of http://phpcrawl.cuab.de/ forked from [mmerian](https://github.com/mmerian/phpcrawl) for using with composer.

### Due to the [main project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpcrawl/files/PHPCrawl/) now seemingly being abandoned (having no updates for 4 years) I am going to proceed to make any changes/fixes in this repository.

[Pull requests](https://github.com/crispy-computing-machine/phpcrawl/pulls) are welcome
